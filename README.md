# MODLR-Process-Examples
This repository hosts a growing collection of sample process scripts for common MODLR functions both in processes and as part of application server side scripts.

## Utility Processes
Utility processes can be copied into new Processes so that you can call them from your processes and server pages to make development of new models easier.

[Utility Processes Listing](/Utilities/Utilities.md)


## Process and Script Examples
Process examples serve to teach common development patterns which are handy when working with MODLR.
